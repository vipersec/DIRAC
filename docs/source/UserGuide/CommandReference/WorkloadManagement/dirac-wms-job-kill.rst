=========================
dirac-wms-job-kill
=========================

  Issue a kill signal to a running DIRAC job

Usage::

  dirac-wms-job-kill [option|cfgfile] ... JobID ...

Arguments::

  JobID:    DIRAC Job ID 

Example::

  $ dirac-wms-job-kill 1918 
  Killed job 1918


Consider that:

- jobs will not disappear from JobDB until JobCleaningAgent has deleted them
- jobs will be deleted "immediately" if they are in the status 'Deleted'
- USER jobs will be deleted after a grace period if they are in status Killed, Failed, Done

What happens when you hit the "kill job" button:
- if the job is in status 'Running', 'Matched', 'Stalled' it will be properly killed, and then it's status will be marked as 'Killed'
- otherwise, it will be marked directly as 'Killed'.
